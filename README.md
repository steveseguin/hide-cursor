# Hide Cursor auto-hot-key-v2 script

This is a simple Autohotkey script to toggle the mouse cursor on and off

It will hide the system mouse cursor when you press the {Left-Windows-Key} button, and then {Left-Mouse-Click}.

Doing this action again will revert it, so you can toggle with LeftWin+LeftClick.

This script is useful if screen sharing via VDO.Ninja with your browser, particularly when gaming, as many browsers do not currently allow the mouse-cursor to be hidden while screen sharing.
